UST2Rec allows you to get a partial reclist in base of oto and USTs. It may be useful for test recording.

== HOW TO USE ==

1. Copy your oto.ini on the same folder as the program itself;
2. If this oto has some prefix (suffix), open "options.ini" file and write it;
2.1. If you have several prefixes (suffixes), it's enough to write one of them;
3. Drag&drop your USTs onto "UST2Rec.exe";
4. Enjoy your partial reclist.
